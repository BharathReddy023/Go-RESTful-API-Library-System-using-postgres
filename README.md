# Go-RESTful-API-Library-System-using-postgres
This project implements a RESTful API for managing a library system using Go. Initially, the data was managed in memory, but it has been upgraded to use a PostgreSQL database for persistent storage. This change enhances the reliability and scalability of the system.
